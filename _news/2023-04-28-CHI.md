Derya, Charles, and Miriah headed to Hamburg for the CHI 2023 conference (on overnight trains!). We had a wonderful and inspiring time catching up with lots of visualization researchers, hosting a visualization meet-up, and presenting new work.

Derya presented her paper [Troubling Collaboration: Matters of Care for Visualization Design Study](https://viscollective.github.io/publications/2023_chi_troubling/).

Charles presented his honorable mention paper [Dirty Data in the Newsroom: Comparing Data Preparation in Journalism and Data Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/group/infovis/pubs/2023/dirty-data-in-the-newsroom/).
