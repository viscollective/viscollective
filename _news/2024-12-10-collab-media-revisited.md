In 2013, Jonas Löwgren and Bo Reimer wrote a book about our joint work at Malmö University, discussing the media forms where infrastructure design, media production and consumption become collaborative practices. We revisited it in a December 2024 seminar, discussing what had happened in the last decade (from social media to "social" media! from use to abuse!) and how to understand it.

The seminar was broadcasted to remote attendees; a Zoom recording is available [here.](https://play.mau.se/media/t/0_cvw6uweq)
