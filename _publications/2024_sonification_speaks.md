abstract: "<p>Traveling by public transport can be challenging for a visually impaired traveler. However, visual information can be supported by sonification, the use of non-speech sound to convey information about data. This research project aims to explore how sonification can be used to provide information to a traveler at a bus stop. Three situations are described together with different sonification design approaches that will later be further developed and evaluated.</p>"
