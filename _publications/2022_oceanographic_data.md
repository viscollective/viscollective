abstract: "<p>The present study is an interdisciplinary endeavour that transmutes science, technology, and aesthetics into an audiovisual experience. The objective is to highlight the potential of combining sonification with visualisation in order to enhance the comprehension of extensive and complex sets of data. Moreover, this paper describes contemporary tools and methods for the implementation of the practice and suggests effective ways to monitor environmental changes. It can be regarded as an exploratory study for familiarisation with the potential of sonification and visualisation in the exploration of environmental data.</p>"
