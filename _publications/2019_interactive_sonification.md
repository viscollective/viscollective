abstract: "<p>The modern control room is predominantly made up of visual displays, which might make monitoring different processes a cumbersome and visually cognitively demanding task. Sonification could be used to support the monitoring task. However, it is not clear how the most beneficial sonification should be designed. In this pilot study an experimental setup was developed to explore perception of different sonification approaches. A user experiment was performed to assess perception of the sonification when and where simulated data deviated most from the normal level. It was found that all sonification conditions were generally useful, regardless of the participant's musical experience, shown both in terms of objective and subjective measurements. Stereo panning of the sound was also generally experienced as helpful, but the use of different pitch might not have been experienced to contribute as much for solving the task. The findings in this pilot study will be further used to create new research ideas about sonification for monitoring of dynamic processes.</p>"
