# Papers are ordered by year. However, in years with many papers, we want some ordering at a lower level. You can do
# that by specifying an order for the papers of that year. For example, 2023-11 will put papers with values lower than
# 2023-11 below that paper. Notice that sorting is lexicographic.

# Don't include a year, or a shorthand for the year, so NOT: InfoVis'14

abstract: "<p>
Concerning the maintenance and upkeep of autonomous warehouses, contemporary developments in industrial digitalization and machine learning are currently fueling a shift from preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance (PdM). We report an ongoing co-design project that explores human-automation collaboration in this direction through a future scenario of baggage handling in an airport where human operators oversee and interact with AI-based predictions. The cornerstones of our design concept are the visualizations of current and predicted system performance and the ability for operators to preview consequences of future actions in relation to performance prediction.
