abstract: "
<p>This thesis explores the use of personal data visualization as a tool to gather insights into the impact that a social organization might have on the participants' lives. Specifically, we collaborated with the Department of Media and Information Technology at Linköping University working with Östergötlands Stadsmission in Norrköping, in the context of their leadership program Trygga Orten. This initiative aims at fostering the independence and community involvement of teenage girls. We provided Stadsmissionen with all the necessary materials to run three workshops. These materials relate to data collection tools, visualization techniques, and broader discussion topics. Our research is supported by an analysis of data humanistic approaches in various fields,and we assess our results with semi-structured interviews with the workshop facilitator. We present our findings and a possible answer to our research question</p>

### Acknowledgements

Our first meeting with Derya was in December 2023. We sat in the Visualization Center cafe
sipping coffee while she introduced this project to us. Little did we know about how supportive
she would be in supervising our thesis, constantly challenging and guiding us with her bright
ideas and inspiring suggestions. Her passion and dynamism are contagious, and we must also
add that she is a research guru and always has the perfect paper for anything. We are happy that
she and Miriah Meyer will continue working with this project, and we are proud of having been
part of it.

A special thanks also goes to Martin, who has collaborated with us and shared valuable
feedback. He deeply cares about his job and the values of Stadsmissionen. His positive attitude
motivated us to be creative and original when making design decisions
