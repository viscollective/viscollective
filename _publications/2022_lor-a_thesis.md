abstract: "
<p>This thesis presents "Data bricks space mission" a toolkit for children that allows them to gather a dataset of information in an engaging and interesting way. The kit is made up of elements that give the opportunity of a first approach to the data physicalization process, breaking down barriers related to knowledge and experience in the field. The experience is completed by a guided activity that, through a role play, inserts the the-me of the data collection in the school curriculum.</p>

<p>The study is based on the analysis of similar previous examples and the collection of information through interviews with instructors who work daily with children. Based on the insights of those theoretical and empirical foundations, a possible solution is presented that addresses the research questions.
