abstract: "
<p>User-centered design can aid visualization designers to build better, more practical tools that meet the needs of cyber security users. The cyber security visualization research community can adopt a variety of design methods to more efficiently and effectively build tools. We demonstrate how previous cyber visualization research has omitted a discussion of effectiveness and process in the explanation of design methods. In this paper, we discuss three design methods and illustrate how each method informed two real-world cyber security visualization projects which resulted in successful deployments to users.</p>"
