abstract: "<p>In complex visual representations, there are several possible challenges for the visual perception that might be eased by addingsound as a second modality (i.e. sonification). It was hypothesized that sonification would support visual perception whenfacing challenges such as simultaneous brightness contrast or the Mach band phenomena. This hypothesis was investigatedwith an interactive sonification test, yielding objective measures (accuracy and response time) as well as subjective measuresof sonification benefit. In the test, the participantâ€™s task was to mark the vertical pixel line having the highest intensity level.This was done in a condition without sonification and in three conditions where the intensity level was mapped to differentmusical elements. The results showed that there was a benefit of sonification, with higher accuracy when sonification was usedcompared to no sonification. This result was also supported by the subjective measurement. The results also showed longerresponse times when sonification was used. This suggests that the use and processing of the additional information took moretime, leading to longer response times but also higher accuracy. There were no differences between the three sonificationconditions.</p>"
