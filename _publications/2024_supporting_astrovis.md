abstract: "<p>This poster presents initial design steps exploring how sonification can be used to support visualization for comprehension of space and time in astronomical data. Radio signals travel at the speed of light. With a visualization of the universe, it is possible to travel faster than light and pass the radio waves leaving earth. We can then travel back in time. We propose to use sonification consisting of songs representing each year as a musical journey through space and time to create an engaging experience.</p>"
