abstract: "<p>Visual representations of data introduce several possible challenges for the human visual perception system in perceiving brightness levels. Overcoming these challenges might be simplified by adding sound to the representation. This is called sonification. As sonification provides additional information to the visual information, sonification could be useful in supporting the visual perception. In the present study, usefulness (in terms of accuracy and response time) of sonification was investigated with an interactive sonification test. In the test, participants were asked to identify the highest brightness level in a monochrome visual representation. The task was performed in four conditions, one with no sonification and three with different sonification settings. The results show that sonification is useful, as measured by higher task accuracy, and that the participant's musicality facilitates the use of sonification with better performance when sonification was used. The results were also supported by subjective measurements, where participants reported an experienced benefit of sonification.</p>"
