The Vis Collective is a research lab focusing on the intersection of visualization, data, and people. We have a particular focus on applied visualization research: we design visualization tools for people in the world, learning new things about visualization, data, and design as we do so.

As a multidisciplinary group, we share an enthusiasm for applying different theoretical foundations in our research. Our ethos values different ways of knowing and being in the world, and our research methods are deliberately diverse. Our work includes elements of computer science, design, HCI, STS, and a general desire to make technology work better for more people.
