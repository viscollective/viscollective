Based in the Department of Science \& Technology at Linköping University, the Vis Collective is a research lab focusing on the intersection of visualization, data, and people. Our work includes elements of computer science, design, HCI, STS, and a general desire to make technology work better for more people.

You can find us in the Norrköping campus of Linköping University. As an old textile city, now the old mills have been converted to university offices and a research park.
